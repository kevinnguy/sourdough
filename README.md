# Sourdough

I built this app to help me calculate my baker ratio when baking sourdough. This is still WIP but it's a functional app on iOS, Android, and web.

This project uses:
- expo (The only consistent way I know of for setting up an environment to support both web and mobile development)
- react-native
- react-native-web
- next
- now 

Todos:
- Refactor ingredients and DRY things up
- Use more hooks
- Fix text input bugs on web
